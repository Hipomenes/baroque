The historiography of Baroque art and culture has encompassed scholars that narrowly limit the term to a select few artistic manifestations, as well as those who view it as nothing less than the *Zeitgeist* or *mentalité* of an entire historical epoch. Scholarly discussions of the Baroque have typically focused on formal aspects, and stylistic attitudes, or seen it as the general expression of a skepticism rooted in a fundamental crisis of representation during the early modern period. The almost pendular alternation of minimalist and maximalists interpretations, combined with theory’s apparent inability to abandon the concept altogether despite art history’s reservations, testifies to its intellectual productivity. We can take one step further and say that the Baroque, as an intellectual matrix, is defined precisely by this capacity to invert, revert, fold and unfold foreground and background, stylistic traits and ethos.   
In this course, we will explore the Baroque, in all its duplicity, as a constellation of figures of thought (hence the notion of "figurations" in the course's title). Figures of thought do not integrate philosophical systems or conceptual apparatuses, but can be better understood as immanence functions and pre-conceptual operations. Due to this liminal, almost clandestine existence, they do not fit well within the history of philosophy, intellectual history, nor the histoire des mentalités. However, by the same token, like enzymes catalyzing (or decomposing) living forms, figures of thought recur transhistorically, as long as certain conditions are met. (For this reason, we will not make a distinction between Baroque and Neo-Baroque). The art and philosophy of the Baroque age were particularly deft at creating those conditions. 
Thus, we will investigate a constellation of Baroque figures of thought, asking every time what a certain figuration does to the plane of immanence; what pre- or para-conceptual operations they perform; how they re-distribute, fracture or refract subjects and objects; and in general what sorts of short-circuits they introduce in Western episteme. It is from this set of questions that we will analyze some recurrent tropes in the study of the historical Baroque such as *decorazione assoluta*, *horror vacui* and the aesthetics of excess; theatralization; anamorphosis and the *perspectives dépravées*; rationalism and the fold; oblique architecture; infinity and calculus. Besides the visual arts and architecture that will structure the seminar, we will read selections of Gottfried Leibniz, Juan Caramuel Lobkowicz, Walter Benjamin, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Lacan, Christine Buci-Glucksmann, José Lezama Lima, Édouard Glissant, Jurgis Baltrušaitis, and Jane Newman, among others. Towards the end of the seminar, we will explore Bolívar Echeverría’s unique blend of Marxism and Baroque theory around the notion of a Baroque alter-modernity from the global South.
